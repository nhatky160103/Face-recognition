# Data Science Lifecycle

Data science is a process divided into five stages:
1. **Capturing**
2. **Processing**
3. **Analysis**
4. **Communication**
5. **Maintenance**

This focuses on **Capturing**, **Processing**, and **Maintenance**.

## 1. Capturing
- **Purpose**: Acquiring data and defining the problem.
- **Questions**:
  - What is the goal?
  - Is the data sufficient and of good quality?
  - Who owns the data, and are there privacy concerns?

## 2. Processing
- **Purpose**: Discover patterns and build models.
- **Techniques**:
  - **Classification**: Categorize data.
  - **Clustering**: Group similar data.
  - **Regression**: Predict relationships between variables.
  
- **Machine Learning**: Models are built to understand data and predict outcomes.

## 3. Maintenance
- **Purpose**: Manage, store, and secure data.
- **Storage**:
  - **On-Premise** vs **Off-Premise** vs **Cloud**.
  - **Hot vs Cold Data**: Frequently accessed vs rarely accessed.
  
- **Security**: Encrypt data, control access, and comply with privacy laws.

This lifecycle ensures data is captured, processed, and maintained for optimal use.
