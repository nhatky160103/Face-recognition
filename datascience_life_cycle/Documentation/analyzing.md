# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Introduction

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps us understand the data and prepare it for modeling. It involves analyzing features, relationships, and identifying problems within the data. In this lesson, weâ€™ll use a Kaggle dataset with word counts from anonymous emails, applying EDA using Python and Pandas.

## What is EDA?

EDA helps answer questions like:
- Do we have enough data to solve the problem?
- Is the data of good quality?
- Should the goals be redefined based on new insights?

### Key Techniques in EDA

- **Data Profiling & Descriptive Statistics**: Use Pandas' `describe()` function to get an overview (count, mean, min, max, standard deviation) of the dataset and assess its quality.
  
- **Sampling**: Sampling helps explore large datasets efficiently. Use the `sample()` function in Pandas for random data samples to make general conclusions.

- **Querying**: The `query()` function helps focus on specific data segments based on conditions, allowing targeted insights.

## Visualizations

Visualizations help identify patterns, relationships, and issues early on. They also make it easier to communicate insights to others. 

## Identifying Inconsistencies

Check for missing or inconsistent values using `isna()` or `isnull()`. Understanding why data is missing helps determine how to address these issues (e.g., filling, removing, or correcting data).
